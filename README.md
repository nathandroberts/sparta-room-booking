### Design Process
The agile methodology was used in order to produce this app. User stories from a product owner were sorted by their priority and difficulty. These tasks were then divided between the team using trello.

At the end of sprint one a minimum viable product was produced and at the end of the week after sprint two this product was further refined ready for a presentation in the academy.
