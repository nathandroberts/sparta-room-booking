# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# room1 = Room.create( name: "Room 1",color: "blue")
#
# bookings = Booking.create([{ date: "2017-11-27", starttime: "9:00:00", endtime: "10:00:00", description: "First booking", room: "Room 1", room_id:room1.id}])

# { name: "Room 2",color: "blue"}, { name: "Room 3",color: "blue"}, { name: "Room 4",color: "blue"}])
